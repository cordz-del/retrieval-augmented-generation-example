# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Example

This repository demonstrates a basic RAG implementation that retrieves information from a dataset and uses an LLM to generate a response.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the demo: `python rag_demo.py`

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that combines retrieval from a dataset and generative response using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of RAG, which enhances the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating relevant information from a dataset during the generation process.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the demo: `python rag_demo.py`
